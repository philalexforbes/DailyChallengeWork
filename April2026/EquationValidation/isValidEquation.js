// Given a string representing a math equation, determine whether it is correct.
//     The left side may contain up to three positive integers and the operators +, -, *, and /.
//     The equation will be given in the format: "number operator number = number" (with two or three numbers on the left). For example: "2 + 2 = 4" or "2 + 3 - 1 = 4".
//     The right side will always be a single integer.
// Follow standard order of operations: multiplication and division are evaluated before addition and subtraction, from left-to-right.
